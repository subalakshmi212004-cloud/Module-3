List Operations in Python: Sum of List Items
🎯 Aim
```
To write a Python program that calculates the sum of all elements in a list.
```
🧠 Algorithm
```
1.Define a list of numbers.
2.Use Python’s built-in sum() function to calculate the total.
3.Print the result.
```
🧾 Program
```
numbers = [14, 16, 18, 22]
total = sum(numbers)
print(total)

```

Regex in Python: Filter Words Without the Letter 'e'
🎯 Aim
```
To write a Python program that filters out and returns all elements from a list that do not contain the letter 'e', using regular expressions (regex).

```
🧠 Algorithm
```
1.Import the re module.
2.Initialize an empty list l1 to store results.
3.Define a list of words:
items = ['goal', 'new', 'user', 'sit', 'eat', 'dinner']
4.Iterate through each word in the list:
 *Use re.search(r"e", i) to check if the word contains 'e'.
 *If not, append the word to l1.
5.Print the final filtered list.
```
🧾 Program
```

import re
l1 = []
items = ['goal', 'new', 'user', 'sit', 'eat', 'dinner']
for i in items:
    if not re.search(r"e", i):
        l1.append(i)
print(l1)
```
Output

🧹 Strings-Remove Nth Index Character from a String
🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that accepts a string and removes the character at a specified index.
🧠 Algorithm
```
1.Define a function named remove that takes the input string as an argument.
2.Read the index n from the user input.
3.Initialize an empty string a to store the new string.
4.Iterate over each index of the string using a for loop.
5.Check if the current index i is not equal to n.
6.If i != n, append the character at index i to string a.
7.After the loop, return the modified string a.
8.Print the final result.
```
💻 Program
```
def remove(string):
    n = int(input())
    a = ""
    for i in range(len(string)):
        if i != n:
            a += string[i]
    print(a)
```
Output

Strings-Palindrome Check in Python (Without Built-in Functions)
🎯 Aim
```
To write a Python program to check whether the string "google" is a palindrome or not, without using built-in palindrome checking functions.
```
🧠 Algorithm
```
1.Assign the string "google" to a variable.
2.Reverse the string manually using slicing ([::-1]).
3.Compare the original string with the reversed string.
*If they are equal, print that the string is a palindrome.
*Otherwise, print that it is not a palindrome.
4.Execute the program.
```
🧾 Program
```
string = "google"
reversed_string = string[::-1]
if string == reversed_string:
    print(f"{string} is a palindrome.")
else:
    print(f"{string} is not a palindrome.")
```
Output

Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence
🎯 Aim
```
To write a Python program that checks if the element 'n' and the element 8 exist within a given tuple.
```
🧠 Algorithm
```
1.Define a tuple x with some letters and numbers.
2.Use the in operator to check if the string 'n' exists within the tuple.
3.Use the in operator to check if the integer 8 exists within the tuple.
4.Print the results.
```
🧾 Program
```
x=("s", 8, "a", "v", "n", "g", "u", "r", "c", "e")
print("n" in a)
print(8 in a)
```
Output
